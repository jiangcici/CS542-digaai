### Project task
Though there exists a large number of personal names on the Web, nationality prediction solely based on names has not been fully studied due to its difficulties in extracting subtle character level features. The goal of our project is to identify Brazilian names from a list of names and differentiating between Hispanic/Latino names that typify as Brazilian and that names that do not. This will assist Digaai in locating and classifying areas in the US with substantial Brazilian immigrant populations.

### Approach
 - Logistic regression
 - KNN
 - LSTM- RNN

### Dataset
The dataset is provided by Kaggle and is shown in the dataset folder. The dataset contains 48,013 samples for training and 11,941 samples for testing.

## How to use the code
### Logistic regression
Run the code in logistic_regression/logistic_regression.ipynb
### KNN
Run the code in KNN/knn.ipynb
### RNN
Run the code in RNN/CS542_project_LSTM.ipynb

## Result
For logistic regression the accuracy is 0.5213

For KNN the accuracy is 0.8219

For LSTM the accuracy is 0.9026
